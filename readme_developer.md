# SAM4K Developer Info

This section is intended for developers setting up / maintaining the project, and is therefore written in english like the code itself.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èOverview

This project is made with focus on Windows. \
Theoretically, everything is coded cross-platform, but its not tested outside of windows.

### Basic functionality:
1. transmitted bytedata is parsed as a [Transmission](#transmission) object
1. shot data of transmission is collected in short-term [Memory](#memoryhandler)
1. if short-term memory holds enough shots for a full series, its moved into long-term memory

There is a long-term memory for every entered person.

### Saving:
On quitting, each persons data is saved in its own section in the same output `.xlsx` file. \
The filenames contains the current date and time. \
They are located in the main directory, sorted in folders by **year** and **month**. \
The file is opened automatically on quitting.

## üì¶Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Logogistiks/sam4k.git
    ```
1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1. Project is ready. Run `SAM_Auswertung.py` to get started.

## üì´Communication with SAM4000

The communication with the device is based on the RS 232 protocol, as written in [the manual](https://github.com/Logogistiks/sam4k/blob/main/SAM4000_Anleitung.pdf) p. 31.

### Communication codes used:

| code    | hex  | sender   | meaning
| ------- | ---- | -------- | -------
| STX     | 0x02 | SAM      | result is ready!
| ENQ     | 0x05 | PC       | is result ready?
| ACK     | 0x06 | PC       | data received correctly
| CR      | 0x0D | SAM      | separator in data block
| NAK     | 0x15 | SAM / PC | result not ready / data not received correctly
| ETB     | 0x17 | SAM      | separates data and checksum
| _EXIT_  | 0xB0 | PC       | log out, SAM goes inactive
| _BAR_   | 0xB1 | PC       | sign in, barcode is used
| _NOBAR_ | 0xB2 | PC       | sign in, barcode is ignored

### Communication process:

* PC sends `BAR` or `NOBAR`
* Loop:
    * PC sends `ENQ`
    * If new strip-data is not available
        * SAM sends `NAK`
    * If new strip-data is available:
        * SAM sends `STX`
        * SAM sends data
        * SAM sends `ETB`
        * SAM sends checksum
        * SAM sends end-byte "$"
        * If data correct: PC sends `ACK`
        * If data not correct: PC sends `NAK`, SAM repeats **from data til "$"**

### Structure of data block:

* 8 bytes: barcode (ASCII 0-9)
* 1 byte: `CR`
* 8 bytes: manual code (ASCII 0-9)
* 1 byte: `CR`
* 2 bytes: target type (ASCII "LG" / "LP" / "KK" / "ZS")
* 1 byte: `CR`
* 2 bytes: number of targets (ASCII "XX")
* 1 byte: `CR`
* 3 bytes: div-divfactor (ASCII "X.X")
* 1 byte: `CR`
* 2 bytes: number of shots (ASCII "XX")
* 1 byte: `CR`
* Repeats "number of targets" times:
    * 4 bytes: ringvalue (ASCII "XX.X")
    * 1 byte: `CR`
    * 6 bytes: div (ASCII "XXXX.X")
    * 1 byte: `CR`
    * 5 bytes: X-distance (ASCII "¬±XXXX")
    * 1 byte: `CR`
    * 5 bytes: Y-distance (ASCII "¬±XXXX")
    * 1 byte: `CR`

Missing values are transmitted as "?" (number of figures is preserved). \
All number values are padded with leading zeroes. \
Divisor, X- and Y-distance are in 1/100 mm from target center.

## üõëExit codes

All occuring errors should be catched and printed to console.  \
If that happens, the program terminates gracefully with a specific exit code:

| code | cause | fix
| ---- | ----- | ---
| 0    | no data to save on quitting | ---
| 2    | cant import external library | `pip install -r requirements.txt`
| 10   | configuration error with `SHOTS_PER_SERIES` | edit `SHOTS_PER_SERIES` at top of file
| 20   | configured serial port not found | check serial ports, set another
| 30   | received empty response from serial | check that device is on, check cable connection
| 99   | non accounted error occured | ...

## üìöDocumentation

List of selected objects and what they do.

### Constants

* #### `PORT`

    The serial port that the device is connected to.

* #### `SHOTS_PER_SERIES`

    How many shots should be saved in a series (one row in the excel file).

* #### `PATTERN_HEADER`

    Which color / gradient the table-head is colored.

* #### `PATTERN_MARK1`

    Which color / gradient the manually corrected shots are colored.

* #### `PATTERN_MARK2`

    Which color / gradient the missing shots are colored in.
